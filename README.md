The smart grid is a cutting-edge power system idea that balances communication and electricity in 
system networks. It gives producers, operators, and consumers access to real-time information. The need 
to effectively manage electricity distribution to different consuming domains, including homes, 
businesses, industries, and smart cities, is growing. In this regard, dynamic power demand must be met 
by a stable smart grid system. Because there are so many affecting factors, predicting the stability of the 
smart grid is still difficult. Participation from producers and consumers is crucial since determining their 
level of involvement can help maintain grid stability. In this study, we suggest a deep learning model for 
smart grid stability prediction that is based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). Other conventional 
machine learning and deep learning classifiers. Such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), are contrasted with the outcomes of the 
suggested GRU model. With a 97.45% accuracy rate, our suggested GRU model outperforms previous 
models in predicting the stability of the smart grid.
